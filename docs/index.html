      <center><h1>Stout Case Study ~ Loan Data from Lending Club</h1>
            <img src="loan_image.jpg" alt="pie chart" width="50%"></center>
      <h3>Description of the Dataset</h3>
            <p>The dataset under investigation contains loan data. In particular, it represents 10 thousands of loans that have been made through the Lending Club 
                  platform. The Lending Club platform is a platform that allows individuals to lend to other individuals.
                  It is important to note that this dataset represents only loans that have been actually made and does not include loan applications that have not been accepted.
                  Thus, we expect that the dataset includes people that seem reliable to pay back a loan, while those that are more likely to pay it back, get a loan with lower 
                  interest rate than those who appear to be riskier.
            </p>
            <p>The dataset contains 55 variables, including the applicant's job title, annual income, credit transactions delinquencies on lines of credit, etc.</p>
              <p> A main issue of the dataset is that some variables contain many missing values. The heatmap that follows presents the missing values for each feature. 10 
            out of 55 variables contain missing values. Most of the missing values belong to variables that are applicable only if the application type is "joint".</p>
            <center><img src="missing_values.png" alt="pie chart" width="50%"></center>
            
            <p>Moreover, in categorical variables, there are some variables that contain many values only once, so we cannot get to a reliable conclusion.
            For instance, there are 4741 unique job titles out of the 10000 instances. To this end, we will omit this variable, since the model is not able to extract 
                  valuable information. </p>
            <p>Another issue of the dataset is the fact that the dependent variable "interest_rate" contains some outliers that can be seen in the boxplot below. </p>

            <center><iframe title="AnnualIncome" src="interest_rate_VS_annual_income.html" width="50%" height="500" style="border:1px solid black;"></iframe></center>
            

            <p>Finally, some variables some features seem be similar and contain almost the same information and, as a result, Principal Component Analysis can be tested.</p>
         
            <h3>Visualizations</h3>
            <p>First of all, we examine the ownership status of the applicant's residence. The pie chart below shows that almost 1 in 2 loans are given to applicants with mortgage, 
                  while only 13.5% of loans are given to individuals with rent.</p>
          
            
         <h3>Model Creation & Results</h3>

            <h3>Future Work</h3>
            <p>Future work includes a better handling of the variable "empl_title" that contains 4741 different categories. These titles could be clustered using
             more generic profession categories, so that the model can have a generic view of the available professions.</p>
