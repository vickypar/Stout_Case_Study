            <img src="loan_image.jpg" alt="pie chart" width="50%"></center>
      <h2>Description of the Dataset</h2>
            <p>The dataset under investigation contains loan data. In particular, it represents 10 thousands of loans that have been made through the Lending Club 
                  platform. The Lending Club platform is a platform that allows individuals to lend to other individuals.
                  It is important to note that this dataset represents only loans that have been actually made and does not include loan applications that have not been accepted.
                  Thus, we expect that the dataset includes people that seem reliable to pay back a loan, while those that are more likely to pay it back, get a loan with lower 
                  interest rate than those who appear to be riskier.
            </p>
            <p>The dataset contains 55 variables, including the applicant's job title, annual income, credit transactions delinquencies on lines of credit, etc.</p>
              <p> A main issue of the dataset is that some variables contain many missing values. The heatmap that follows presents the missing values for each feature.</p>
