      <center><h1>Stout Case Study ~ Loan Data from Lending Club</h1>
            <img src="loan_image.jpg" alt="pie chart" width="50%"></center>
      <h3>Description of the Dataset</h3>
            <p>The dataset under investigation contains loan data. In particular, it represents 10 thousands of loans that have been made through the Lending Club 
                  platform. The Lending Club platform is a platform that allows individuals to lend to other individuals.
                  It is important to note that this dataset represents only loans that have been actually made and does not include loan applications that have not been accepted.
                  Thus, we expect that the dataset includes people that seem reliable to pay back a loan, while those that are more likely to pay it back, get a loan with lower 
                  interest rate than those who appear to be riskier.
            </p>
            <p>The dataset contains 55 variables, including the applicant's job title, annual income, credit transactions delinquencies on lines of credit, etc.</p>
              <p> A main issue of the dataset is that some variables contain many missing values. The heatmap that follows presents the missing values for each feature. 10 
            out of 55 variables contain missing values. Most of the missing values belong to variables that are applicable only if the application type is "joint".</p>
            <center><img src="missing_values.png" alt="pie chart" width="50%"></center>
            
            <p>Moreover, in categorical variables, there are some variables that contain many values only once, so we cannot get to a reliable conclusion
                  about their relation with the interest rate.
            For instance, in variable "emp_title", there are 4741 unique job titles out of the 10000 instances. To this end, we will omit this variable, since the model is not able to extract 
                  valuable information. On the contrary, some variables have only one unique value (e.g. num_accounts_120d_past_due, num_accounts_120d_past_due), or most of 
            observations have the same value (e.g num_accounts_30d_past_due, current_accounts_delinq, num_accounts_30d_past_due, paid_late_fees).</p>
            <p>Another issue of the dataset is the fact that the dependent variable "interest_rate" contains some outliers that can be seen in the boxplot below. </p>
            <center><iframe title="Interest" src="interest_rate/interest_rate.html" width="50%" height="500" style="border:1px solid black;"></iframe></center>
            <p>Finally, some variables seem to be similar and contain almost the same information and, as a result, Principal Component Analysis can be tested.</p>
         
            <h3>Visualizations</h3>
            <p>First of all, we examine the ownership status of the applicant's residence. The pie chart below shows that almost 1 in 2 loans are given to applicants with mortgage, 
                  while only 13.5% of loans are given to individuals with rent.</p>
            <center><iframe title="Homeownership" src="homeownership.html" width="50%" height="500" style="border:1px solid black;"></iframe></center>
            
            <p>In the pie chart below, we present the percentages of the application types: if it is "joint" or "individual". It is obvious that most of applications
            refer to individuals.</p>
            <center><iframe title="ApplicationType" src="application_type.html" width="50%" height="500" style="border:1px solid black;"></iframe></center>
            
            <p>Moreover, we present the different states, that people who get loans come from, in the following bar chart. It is obvious that most of people come from 
            New Jersey (NJ). </p>
            <center><iframe title="State" src="state.html" width="50%" height="500" style="border:1px solid black;"></iframe></center>
            
            <p>Since the dependant variable is the interest rate, it is important to examine how it is associated with some of the independant variables.</p>
            <p>First, we analyze the association between annual income and the provided interest rate. To this end, the following scatterplot shows 
            the interest rate as a function of the annual income in case the income is "verified", "not verified", or "source verified". 
            As expected, large values of interest rates are given to people with low income since they are less reliable. On the contrary, the interest rate 
                  to applicants with high annual income that is verified or source verified is by far less.</p> 
            <center><iframe title="AnnualIncome" src="interest_rate_VS_annual_income.html" width="50%" height="500" style="border:1px solid black;"></iframe></center>
            
            <p>Next, in order to analyze how the interest rate varies according to the reasons that people get loans, we present the following boxplots. 
            We do not observe high variations of the interest rate based on the loan purpose. However, the largest mean value of interest rate belongs to 
            "vacation" loans, while the lowest one belongs to loans for house purchase.</p>
            <center><iframe title="LoanPurpose" src="loan_purpose.html" width="50%" height="500" style="border:1px solid black;"></iframe></center>
                     
            <p>Finally, we present a pie chart of the number of delinquencies that applicants had the last two years.</p>
            <center><iframe title="Num_Delinquencies" src="num_delinquencies.html" width="50%" height="500" style="border:1px solid black;"></iframe></center>
            <p>As expected, loans are given to people with a small number of delinquencies (less than 14), while almost 85% of loans are given to people with no 
                  delinquencies during the last 2 years.</p>
            <p>The figure that follows presents the association between the number of delinquencies and the interest rate. For less than 7 delinquencies the mean value of interest 
                  rate increases with the number of delinquencies. After that, we cannot reach to a conclusion, since the percantage of observations is low.</p>
            <center><iframe title="Delinquencies" src="delinquencies.html" width="50%" height="500" style="border:1px solid black;"></iframe></center>        
            
         <h3>Model Creation & Results</h3>
            <p>In this section, we describe the steps followed to create a model that predicts the interest rate. First of all, we factorize the categorical variables
            and drop the unnecessary columns where missing values exist in more than 50% of the observations or the categorical variables where
                  there are more than 4000 unique values. Next, we fill the missing values of variables that regard joint loans using values from the equivalent individual ones.</p>
            <p>We split the dataset into training and test set (70/30%) and impute the numerical variables using the mean value of the feature in the training set.
            The last preprocessing step includes standarizing the data using the StandardScaler.</p>
            <p>The algorithms that will be tested include "XGBoost", "k-Nearest-Neighbors", "Gradient Boosting", and "AdaBoost". In order to select the most suitable
            hyperparameters, we further split the training set into training and validation set. Since this is a regression problem, the evaluation metrics 
            that will be used are "Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)", "R-squared", and "Mean Absolute Error". The first one is used for the hyperparameter selection.</p>
            <p>The following figures present the "rmse" for different values of hyperparameters of each algorithm.</p>
            <center><iframe title="Xgboost" src="xgboost.html" width="50%" height="500" style="border:1px solid black;"></iframe></center>
            <center><iframe title="Knn" src="knn.html" width="50%" height="500" style="border:1px solid black;"></iframe></center>
            <center><iframe title="GradientBoosting" src="gradient_boosting.html" width="50%" height="500" style="border:1px solid black;"></iframe></center>
            <center><iframe title="Adaboost" src="adaboost.html" width="50%" height="500" style="border:1px solid black;"></iframe></center>
            
            <p>Finally, after selecting the best values for the hyperparameters, we train each algorithm using the initial training set and test set. The results
            are presented in the figure below.</p>
            <center><iframe title="Results" src="results.html" width="50%" height="500" style="border:1px solid black;"></iframe></center>
            <p>It is obvious that k-NN performs poorly, while XGBoost achieves the highest value of r-squared and lowest values of rmse and mae.</p>
            <h3>Future Work</h3>
            <p>Future work includes better handling of the variable "empl_title" that contains 4741 different categories. These titles could be clustered using
             more generic profession categories, so that the model can obtain a generic view of the available professions. Moreover, additional visualizations (or statistical tests)
                 between each feature and the interest rate could show if there are associated and, if not, these features could be omitted.
            Finally, more alogoritms could be tested along with higher hyperparameter tuning.</p>
